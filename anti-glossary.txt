Anti-glossary
=====================
=====================
#001. People of color
---------------------
First thing first, people are not nail polish to be categorized by their color of skin. Second, this phrase is loaded and racist and implicates that some people are colorless and transparent!!
Alternative: different races of people. 
=====================
#002: White and other colors
---------------------
Unless used for non-human creatures I beilve categorizeing people by colors has no relevance to anything except discrimination. Exceptionly, I would call someone Mr./Mrs. White/Green if that's is the way that they want to be called.
Alternative: there is not need for any alternative as there is see no use for it. Let me if you see any use.
=====================
#003. She/he
---------------------
Unless someone specifically wants to be refered as "she" or "he" or "Xe" and so on; I don't see any use for gendered pronouns.
Alternative: one/one's or person/per/pers (I don't have any problem with "zhe" or any alternative as far as it finds its place in english)
=====================
#004. Latinx, Latino, Latina
---------------------
Latin is a rich language and already has a gender-neutral prounoun: latini
Alternative: Latini
=====================
#005. they(reffered to one person)
---------------------
It's simply ambigious; unless someone specifically wants to be refered as "they" I won't refere any individual as "they"
Alternative: person or one
=====================
#006. Native American
---------------------
Anyone who was born in America is a native American. That includes Richard Stallman!
As regards the indigenous peoples of the US, I would call them "indigenous peoples", the same term I use for all the rest of the world.
