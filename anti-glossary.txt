Anti-glossary
=====================
=====================
#001. People of color
---------------------
First thing first, people are not nail polish to be categorized by their color of skin. 
Second, this phrase is loaded and racist and implicates that some people are colorless and transparent!!
Alternative: different races of people. 
=====================
#002: White and other colors
---------------------
Unless used for non-human creatures I believe categorizeing people by the colors has no relevance to anything except discrimination. 
Exceptionly, I would call someone Mr./Mrs. White/Green if that's the way that they want to be called.
Alternative: there is no need for any alternative as I see no use for it. Let me know if you see any use.
=====================
#003. Latinx, Latino, Latina
---------------------
Latin is a rich language and already has a gender-neutral prounoun: latini
=====================
#004. Native American
---------------------
"Anyone who was born in America is a native American." That includes Richard Stallman!
"As regards the indigenous peoples of the US, I would call them "indigenous peoples", the same term I use for all the rest of the world." --Richard Stallman.
